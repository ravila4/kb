## Welcome to my Personal Knowledge Base!

### What is a knowledge base?

From Wikipedia:
>A knowledge base (KB) is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system.

### A knowledge base for humans

To me, a knowledge base is just a structured notebook or library of interconnected topics (think Wikipedia). My personal KB is an attempt at organizing and offloading knowledge from topics that I come across often, but not necessarily use on a daily basis.
