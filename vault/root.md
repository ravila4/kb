## Welcome to my Personal Knowledge Base!

![](/assets/images/profile.jpg)

I am a bioinformatics programmer, currently working at the Scripps Research Institute.

I enjoy learning about technology, science, and art. ðŸ’» ðŸ§¬ ðŸŽ¨

This is my attempt at organizing and offloading knowledge from topics that I come across often, but not necessarily use on a daily basis, or things that I am in the process of learning.
