## Welcome to my Knowledge Base!

### What is a knowledge base?

From Wikipedia:
>A knowledge base (KB) is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system.

### A knowledge base for humans

To me, a knowledge base is just a fancy notebook or library of interconnected topics (think Wikipedia). My personal KB is an attempt at organizing knowledge from topics that I come across often, but not necessarily use on a daily basis.

I believe that it is only worth memorizing the information that we use often enough, and as such, this KB acts as an intermediary between the first steps of learning and internalization.
